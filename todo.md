# Syncing an onboarded shopify store
- Store their integration
- Begin syncing:
    - products
    - customers
    - orders
    - fields defined, limit the amount per page and go through until no records
- async insert_all v fast, chunked etc.
- need to be scoped by shop
- needs to be durable, using oban
- then i need to stay in sync somehow
    - probably by a cronjob that will sync the 3 each day or something
